Martingale-Roulette
===================

Simulates Roulette using Martingale betting theory.

I went to Vegas this summer and for the first time played Roulette.  I was curious about the betting method some people
were using where they bet on the same thing each time, but doubled their bet every time they lost the previous bet. Their
theory was that if their next bet won, the win would recuperate the previous bet's loss and then some, turning the prior
loss into a small gain.  I wrote this app after returning to my hotel after a long night of drinking, so don't expect a
masterpiece :).
